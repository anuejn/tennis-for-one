# Tennis For One
A small audio-only game about the sound of playing tennis

Done as a two week project for a games workshop at my university with Prof. Auriea Harvey and Tobias Zagres.
This includes a also a small print addon (see [tennis-for-one.pdf](tennis_for_one.pdf)) that was the thing I handed in.

## Play It
1. Point your phone to https://anuejn.github.io/tennis-for-one
2. Plug in your headphones and wear them
3. Press "START GAME"
4. Close Your eyes. Imagine you are standing at the tennis court 
5. You serve. Swing your racket (your phone)
6. Observe the sound of the ball and your opponent. 
7. In the right moment and on the right side, use your racket again 


(alternatively you can also play on a computer using the left and right arrow keys)

## Limitations:
Currently, most android phones I tried to play with had horrible input-lag.
Iphones worked better for this game
